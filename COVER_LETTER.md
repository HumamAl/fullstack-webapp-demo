Hi,

React + Spring Boot + Node.js with Oracle, full Playwright test coverage, and 7-8 hours a day US time — I built a working version of this stack before reaching out: https://fullstack-webapp-demo.vercel.app

The demo covers the React frontend with Material UI component patterns, a Node.js service layer, and a SQL-backed data model — the core of what you're running day-to-day.

Previously built a 6-module Fleet Maintenance SaaS with complex relational data and role-based views from scratch to production.

Is the Spring Boot layer handling business logic only, or are there Node.js microservices running alongside it for specific domains?

10-minute call or I can scope the first sprint in a doc — your pick.
